I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

I'm using [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) as a test since it's easy to understand.

UI created in Qt Designer

Click on run.bat to run the program, the bat file will install pyside6, qdarkstyle and requests if they are not already installed on your system and start the application.

Best Regards,<br/>
Brian
